# CSV Data Analyzer and Morse Code Translator (COMP 1012 Coursework 2)

This repository contains my submission for the COMP 1012 coursework assignment. It includes a Python module `leopard.py` for analyzing CSV data and a JavaScript function within `morsecode.html` for encoding and decoding Morse code.

## Description

The project consists of two main parts:
- **CSV Data Analyzer (`leopard.py`)**: A Python module for reading and analyzing data from CSV files. It provides functionality to get statistics and count instances based on criteria.
- **Morse Code Translator (`morsecode.html`)**: A JavaScript-based Morse code encoder and decoder, capable of translating text to and from Morse code.

### Features

- **CSV Data Analysis**:
  - Read and validate CSV files.
  - Extract statistics such as mean, min, max, and count.
  - Generate HTML reports from the CSV data.
  - Count instances of data matching specific criteria.
  
- **Morse Code Translation**:
  - Encode and decode text to and from Morse code.
  - Handle input validation and display alerts for invalid inputs.
  - Interactive HTML page for real-time Morse code translation.

## Installation

To run the Python scripts, you need Python installed on your system, with access to the `csv` module.
For the JavaScript Morse code translator, any modern web browser will suffice.

## Usage

### Python Module
Navigate to the directory containing `leopard.py` and run:
```bash
python leopard.py
```
Make sure to adjust the script to accept command line arguments or modify it according to your testing framework.

## JavaScript Morse Code Translator
Open morsecode.html in a web browser and use the interface to encode or decode Morse code.

## Contributing

Since this project is part of an academic coursework, I do not take 100% owenrship of the project.
